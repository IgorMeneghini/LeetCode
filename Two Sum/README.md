This is an efficient approach to this coding problem. I'm using a hash map to reduce the time complexity. I had previously solved this problem using brute force, which involved nested loops and checking one by one. However, that algorithm was slower than this one. Here, if the sum equals the target, we return the index of the element contributing to that sum. It's better to use a hash map for this problem because, in the worst case, the algorithm's time complexity is O(n). We iterate through the list, checking if the current number subtracted by the target equals some number in the list.
